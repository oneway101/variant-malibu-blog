This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains our privacy practices, including what types of information we collect from you and how we may use it, our rights to share and disclose such information to third parties and how you can review and modify information that you provide to us and your preferences regarding our use and disclosure of such information. Please review our Terms of Use Agreement (Terms of Use), which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use.

This Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected by and any of their respective affiliates (collectively, “G/A/P”, “we”, “our” or “us”) or any third parties acting with our authorization or otherwise provided to us by third parties about you, in each instance, in connection with your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing the Services as a registered user or otherwise.

By using or interacting with the Services, you are consenting to the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please do not use the Services.

What Information is collected from you?

Registration Information. When you register to use the Services, we may ask you to provide certain information, including your name, username, password, e-mail, date of birth, gender, address and music, artist or band preferences.
Payment Information. If you make any purchase on or through the Services, your payment information (e.g., credit or debit card type, number and expiration date) and related information (e.g., physical address) may be collected by us and/or our third party payment processors.
Information You Optionally Provide to Us. We collect any information you provide on or through the Services or give us in any other way. For example, we collect any information you provide when you update your user account and profile, order a product or service, submit content, provide feedback, participate in discussion forums, participate in contests, surveys and other promotions relating to the Services, interact with customer service and sign up to receive newsletters and other communications regarding the Services and/or third-party products or services. In addition, the Services may include features that rely on the use of information stored on, or made available through, your mobile device. For example, you may have the option to upload photos to your user profile or allow us access to your contacts so that we can help you connect with friends that are users of the Services (e.g., by matching e-mail addresses and/or phone numbers). Please note that local law may require that you get permission from your contacts to provide their contact information to us before allowing us to access this information. We may also ask to collect or use the specific location of your mobile device (e.g., by accessing your device’s GPS). We will not access or collect your photos, contacts or specific location information from your mobile device without your express permission and will only use such information for the specific purposes described herein and/or explained at the time we ask for your permission. You may grant such permission by adjusting your device settings and/or your user account settings to allow the applicable access and/or by responding to G/A/P’s request for such permission. (Please note that such location information does not include IP address, which we may continue to use as described in this Privacy Policy, including for purposes of determining what country you’re in.) As a general note, you can choose not to provide certain information, but you may not be able to access certain content or take advantage of certain promotions or features of the Services.
Usage Data and Technical Information. The Services include features that automatically collect certain information, which may include the unique device identifier assigned to your device, Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers, and other information regarding your use of the Services to, among other things, assist us in authenticating your usage and/or device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience and better serving your particular interests and needs. The Services and/or third parties may use “cookies,” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), “embedded scripts”, “pixel tags” and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect information automatically as you interact with the Services. Such information may include “clickstream” data, the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type and attributes, Internet protocol (IP) address, network connection type (e.g., WiFi, 3G, LTE), browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on the Services, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and your interactions with playlists, audiovisual content, other users of the Services, advertising, and products and services which are offered, linked to or made available on or through the Services. Such information may be collected by us and/or our third-party service providers and partners. Certain Tracking Technologies enable us to customize your experience on the Services and provide tailored recommendations, promotions, advertisements and other content relating to your specific interests. Other Tracking Technologies are used to make login to the Services easier (such as by remembering your user ID) and allow us to collect non- specific location information. For example, we need to know which country you are in, as some of our content licenses may be location-specific.
Third Party Platform Information. If you access the Services via your Third Party Platform account (e.g., by logging in to the Services using your Third Party Platform account credentials) and/or integrate your G/A/P account with your Third Party Platform account, we may collect certain information from the Third Party Platform, such as your username and other information you provided to the Third Party Platform in connection with your account (e.g., name, country, date of birth, gender and e-mail address).
You can adjust your settings and preferences with respect to Third Party Platforms. We provide you with the ability to adjust certain privacy, permission and user account settings via the Services. For example, you can control whether your user profile is visible to the public and/or to other users of the Services. You can also control whether or not you want to share certain information (such as your playlists or videos that you have viewed) on Third Party Platforms. You also may be able to adjust certain privacy, permission and user account settings by responding to request alerts or notifications that may be presented to you on your device prior to or following the collection of the relevant information or by navigating to the settings, account or privacy section (as the case may be) of your device or the applicable Third Party Platform and limiting certain Service functionality (e.g., location services, etc.). Please be aware that if you limit the collection of certain information, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the Services.

Information Collected By Advertising Service Providers. The Services may also use third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) that may employ cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the Services, your web browsing activity and your device, including your IP address, device type and other identifiers, browser type, web pages visited, non-precise location information, and information about your interaction with advertisements. Further information on the types of information collected by Third Party Advertising Service Providers is described herein, how such information may be used and your choices pertaining to such collection and use.

This information is collected in an anonymized, de-identified format and does not personally identify you. Third Party Advertising Service Providers may combine your information relating to your use of the Services with information relating to your other online activities over time and across different websites (including those operated by third parties) and devices. The information collected or received by Third Party Advertising Service Providers may be used to show you targeted advertisements for products and services that you might be interested in, on the Services and on third party websites and services.

You can choose whether to receive marketing or promotional emails from our parent or affiliated companies or other third parties and/or to opt out of certain uses of your information either at the time such information is collected or by subsequently changing your preferences, as further described below.

You can unsubscribe or opt out of receiving marketing and promotional communications by following the specific instructions included in such communications. Please note that opt-out and unsubscribe requests may not take effect immediately and may take a reasonable amount of time to receive, process and apply, during which time your information shall remain subject to the prior privacy settings.

We may share your personal information with such co-branded partners and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt in and give your affirmative consent to both us and our co-branded partners to collect any information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such information for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes in accordance with our respective privacy policies. The co-branded partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service, along with the co-branded partner’s privacy policy. If you wish to opt out of a co-branded partner’s future use of your personal information for marketing or other purposes, you will need to contact the co-branded partner directly and the use of such information by co-branded partner is subject to co-branded partner’s privacy policy.

Your G/A/P user profile (including your profile picture and your list of friends or connections on the Services) may be set to “private” by default, meaning that it may not be shared with other users of the Services, unless you adjust your privacy settings to allow such sharing. However, the Services may include features that allow you to connect on the Services with people you know, by accessing your contact list, address book or friends on Third Party Platforms (if you choose to make such information available to us), and such features may allow other users to see your name and/or username, even if your user profile is set to “private”. Such features may also allow other users to send you a request to connect with you on the Services, and, if you accept such requests, your user profile will be shared with such users, even if your user profile is set to “private”. In addition, you may have the ability to share other content that you submit with other users of the Services and Third Party Platforms. In such cases, certain information associated with such content may also be disclosed, such as your username. Subject to your user account preferences and privacy settings (as further described herein we may disclose any content that you make available on the Services.

We use third-party service providers to assist us in efficiently providing the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions offered by the Services, and we may disclose your personal and other information to these service providers solely to the extent necessary for them to provide such services to us and our affiliates. These service providers may temporarily store certain information on their servers, but they may only use your information to provide G/A/P with a specific service. We will not authorize them to use your information for any other purpose and will require them to agree to keep your information secure and confidential.

G/A/P may access or disclose your information regardless of whether or not you have consented to such access or disclosure in the following circumstances: (i) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of G/A/P, our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) to protect the safety and security of the Services and our users; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) if we believe your actions violate the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, any Rules and/or Additional Terms; or (v) to comply with law or legal process. In addition, if G/A/P sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, G/A/P may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction, and such party or parties may use the information for the purposes set forth in, and in accordance with the terms of, this Privacy Policy.

The Services may be linked to, rely on and/or be integrated with Third Party Platforms and other websites, applications, interfaces, services and/or platforms operated by other companies. The Services may also feature advertisements from third parties. G/A/P is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites, applications, interfaces, services and platforms operated by third parties that are linked to, rely on and/or integrated with the Services or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Once you leave this Services via such a link, access a third party application, interface, service, or platform, including Third Party Platforms, or click on or navigate to an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of such third party to determine, among other things, how they will handle any personally identifiable or other information that they may collect from you.

How can you provide, update or correct your information?

We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Website.

We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Website. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.

It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update such information. We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?

You may change certain privacy preferences (e.g., choose to cease receiving certain communications or ask us not to share your personal information with a particular third party) as needed. If you ask G/A/P to stop using your personal information, we will honor that request, provided that we may retain a record of such information as necessary to comply with applicable law and we may continue to use your contact information to contact you about your Services-related transactions and to respond to your requests, as well as your IP address to determine the country in which you are accessing the Services. Other privacy preferences (e.g., hiding your user profile, deactivating your user account, etc.) may be made by modifying your user account settings on the Services, your device and/or the applicable Third Party Platform. You always have the right to access, review and correct the personal information you have provided and generally you may review, update or delete certain information collected by the Services at any time by accessing your user account as described herein.

What Security Precautions Are In Place To Protect Against The Loss, Misuse, Or Alteration Of Your Information?

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge, as a further condition on use of Services, that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.

While no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. We also limit access to the Services by our own employees, contractors, service providers and those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information. We request that our third party contractors and service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality as those followed by G/A/P. However, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications despite our efforts to prevent the same and we therefore make no guarantees regarding the security of user information.

Are your rights different based on your location or age?

California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: users can visit our site anonymously; once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website, our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above, you will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy page, you may change your personal information by emailing us.

If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt out or opt in for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that have received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to our Privacy Administrator. For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California Privacy Rights”, include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via the telephone or by fax. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.

G/A/P recognizes the need to adequately protect the privacy of all if its users, especially children. You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this Website. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors that are under 18 years of age.

The Services are not intended for or directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Please visit http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy online. COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act): We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

When you have provided consent and/or to the extent permitted by applicable privacy or data protection laws, your personal information may be transferred to, stored, processed and/or used by G/A/P on servers in the United States and/or the locations and servers of any G/A/P affiliate and/or service provider that transfers, stores, processes or uses personal information on G/A/P’s behalf. When this involves transferring your personal information from the European Economic Area to areas outside the European Economic Area, G/A/P will seek to provide an adequate level of data protection according to EU standards. If you access the Services in any country outside the European Union, the data controller is G/A/P.
