    content: "Our patented Customizer uses 3D modeling to show you exactly how your garment will look and fit on your body. 3D knitting produces custom, made to measure, three-dimensional garments directly from the machine, so each piece requires less sewing and has more comfort and durability. Our knitwear technicians can inlay smart fibers, fabrics and even sensors into each pattern; breathability and ventilation can be built in according to your measurements. Our process is ideal for apparel, and fashion and home accessories."
