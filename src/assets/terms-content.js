PAYMENTS AND FEES

G/A/P may save User’s credit or debit card information and use it for all future shipments and charges, which will automatically be charged to the saved card, unless the User notifies G/A/P through the Site. When you order a product, or use a Service that has a fee, you will be charged then current fees, which we may change from time to time (such when we have holiday sales or offer you discount of base product price). We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our Services for promotional events or new Services, and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event or new Service on the Site. The sale will be submitted for processing and you will be charged as soon as you click on the “confirm” button. You will then receive an e-mail from us.

By placing an order through the Site, you are confirming that you are legally entitled to use the means of payment tendered and, in the case of card payments, that you are either the cardholder or have the cardholder’s express permission to utilize the card to effect payment.

In case of an unfounded chargeback, the User shall reimburse G/A/P for its losses, which consist of fulfillment costs and chargeback handling fees ($15 USD per chargeback).

We may refuse to process a transaction for any reason or refuse Service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of refusing or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.

Unless otherwise stated, all fees and payments are quoted in U.S. Dollars. The User is responsible for paying all fees, payments and applicable taxes associated with our Site and Services. After receiving your order you will receive an e-mail from us confirming the details, description and price for the products ordered together with some information on your rights to return your goods. Payment of the total price plus taxes and delivery must be made in full before dispatch of your products.

Discounts apply to eligible monthly recurring charges before taxes, shipping and other fees. Discounts are awarded only to Users over certain threshold of monthly revenue in the preceding calendar month. These tiers are listed on our Site and are subject to change. G/A/P at its sole discretion may change, suspend or discontinue these discounts at any time.

LOCAL TAXES

User is responsible for (and shall charge) all sales taxes, VAT and other taxes and duties associated with the products (if and as applicable). If the User is located in California or North Carolina, it is required to provide a valid California Resale Certificate or North Carolina Resale Certificate or all orders sent to California/ North Carolina are subject to California/North Carolina sales tax rates on top of retail rates.

If the User is located in California, California tax rate is calculated as a percentage of retail price when it is provided to G/A/P by User. When retail price of goods is unknown, G/A/P calculates tax rate from G/A/P price plus 10% in accordance with California Regulation 1706 if goods are shipped to California, or tax rate from G/A/P price if goods are shipped to North Carolina.

SHIPPING AND RETURNS

Once you have clicked on the “confirm” button, it might be not possible to edit or cancel your order. If you want to change some parameters, Customer addresses, etc., please check whether such an option is available in your account. We are not bound to make such modifications in your order, but we will do our best on a case-by-case basis. Replacement of products and credits to the User’s account for products claimed as damaged or not received are subject to G/A/P investigation and discretion.

The risk of loss and title for such items pass to the User upon our delivery to the carrier. It is the Customer’s responsibility to file any claim with a carrier for a lost shipment if carrier tracking indicates that the product was delivered. In such case G/A/P will not make any refunds and will not resend the product.

G/A/P will review replacement/return requests only (a) if there will be missing or broken product, or a print error if it is G/A/P fault and (b) if G/A/P receives a complaint within 30 days from the day the product was delivered to the Customer (or within 30 days after the estimated delivery date, if the product is missing).

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS

Whilst many component parts of our products are standard, all products available for purchase are described on their specific design page on our Site. We always try to represent each design as accurately as possible via photography and copy points provided by designers, artists or photographers.

We have a policy of continuous product development so we can provide you with what we consider the best design combined with best performance, and thus reserve the right to amend the specifications of products, their price, packaging and any Service associated at any time, without prior notice. Before ordering, we thus invite you to have a close look at the product description and design.

We use our best efforts to provide you with the best images and descriptions, but unfortunately cannot guarantee that colors and details in website images are 100% accurate representations of the product, and sizes might in some cases be approximate.

Sometimes during the manufacturing process products can be damaged, obviously they won’t be shipped out to Users and Customers, however they can still be used for charitable purposes. G/A/P reserves the right to donate all damaged items with full or partial designs to charity and the User hereby waives its right to collect royalties or other fees regarding damaged products that are donated.

PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS

Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product, which is accepted by us once we have sent you an e-mail order confirmation. Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a order confirmation e-mail do not form part of that contract.

G/A/P shall under no circumstances be held liable for any special losses due to specific circumstances of the User an/or Customer, indirect or consequential losses or wasted expenditure.

Orders are placed and received primarily via the Site, at our sole discretion. Before ordering from us, it is the User’s responsibility to check and determine full ability to receive the products. Correct Customer’s address and post code/zip code, User’s up-to-date telephone number and e-mail address are absolutely necessary to ensure successful delivery of products.

All information asked on the checkout page must be filled in precisely and accurately. G/A/P will not be responsible for missed delivery because of a wrong delivery address or an inappropriate phone number. Should you like to ask for a change in the delivery address, notify change in a phone number or any other special requirements, please contact G/A/P

DELIVERY

We deliver to Users/Customers to most places in the world. User shall cover delivery costs. Delivery prices are additional to the product’s price and may vary depending on delivery location and/or sort of products, and additional charges may be added to the order for remote or difficult to access locations that require special attention. Flat rate delivery charges are shown on our checkout page; however we reserve the right to advise you of any additional delivery charges that apply to your specific delivery address.

Some sort of products are packaged and shipped separately. We cannot guarantee delivery dates and accept no responsibility, apart from advising you of any known delay, for products that are delivered after the estimated delivery date. Flat rate delivery times are shown on the Site. It is only an average estimation, and some delivery can take longer, or alternatively be delivered much faster. All delivery estimates given at the time of placing and confirming order are subject to change. In any case, we will do our best to contact you and advise you of all changes. We try our best to make delivery of product as simple as possible.

Ownership of the products will only pass to you/Customer when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the products, including delivery charges and taxes.

INVESTIGATIONS

G/A/P reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms of Use, including without limitation any violation arising from any Submission, posting or email you make or send. G/A/P may seek to gather information from the user who is suspected of violating these Terms of Use and from any other user. G/A/P may suspend any users whose conduct or postings are under investigation and may remove such material from its servers as it deems appropriate and without notice.

BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS G/A/P FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY G/A/P DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER G/A/P OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

If a dispute arises we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court. We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly. If your dispute is not resolved by Customer Service, before beginning arbitration, you must first send written notice describing the claim to the Office of the General Counsel at the following address:

G/A/P

ATTN: General Counsel

327 S. Latigo Canyon Road

Malibu, California 90265

818.540.2475

info@variant.group

If the claim has not been resolved within 60 days of receipt of the notice you may then commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 877-495-4185.

Thereafter, any unresolved dispute or claim relating in any way to the Website or Services including without limitation claims relating to the breach of the Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy (“Dispute”), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis. You and G/A/P each reserve respectively the right to seek a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order from a federal or state court in Ventura County, California and, after such request for relief has been heard by such court, the remainder of the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration as set forth herein.

The arbitration shall be governed by the California Arbitration Act (“CAA”) (California Code Civ. Proc., §1280 et seq.) in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of America Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect at the time the arbitration commences. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or G/A/P may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions (subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant); otherwise, the arbitration shall take place in Ventura County, California. The arbitration shall be governed by California law. All of the fees and costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties participating therein. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. Attorneys’ fees may be awarded to the prevailing party at the discretion of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall neither have power to alter or amend this Agreement, nor power to award any relief inconsistent with the provisions herein or unavailable in a court of law, nor power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning. The arbitrator’s award shall, at a minimum, be a reasoned award. The arbitrator’s award may be appealed, and may be vacated or corrected on appeal, solely pursuant to the appellate arbitration rules of AAA in effect at the time the arbitration commences (“Appellate Rules”) and the arbitrator’s award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Thereafter, the arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and G/A/P BOTH HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER

ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. You and G/A/P further agree that they shall not participate in any class action (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under this agreement or in connection with the Sites. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then such class action is not subject to arbitration and must be litigated in state or federal court in Ventura County in the state of California and the entirety of the foregoing arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial as set forth above; even in that case, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
